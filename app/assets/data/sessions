It’s no longer normal or acceptable for developers to sit and develop applications in isolation from the business. To that end, developers and business domain experts have been trying to find better ways to communicate. While developers tend to speak in terms of “code and technology” most business domain experts are more comfortable communicating in terms of scenarios, workflows and business rules.\n Test Driven Development (TDD) was the first step in getting these two groups to communicate in the same way. Developers could write unit tests that expressed business requirements with the hope that business users could validate that what was being tested was in fact what the desired behavior was. But, unit tests are still code and while it was better, the communication was still stilted and inefficient.\n\nTo help this communication new techniques such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) have become popular. Along with these new ideas, new tools like SpecFlow have become popular as a means to express unit tests in a way that the business can better understand and validate.\n\nThis session will demonstrate how SpecFlow can be leveraged in your BDD or ATDD practices. In this session you will learn what SpecFlow is and how to integrate it into your .NET project. The Gherkin language and the “Given, When, Then” paradigm will be explained. You will see how to write tests in a way that business users are not only capable of reading, but can also help you create them.\n","Start":"2013-01-10T20:35:00Z","Room":"Portia/Wisteria","Difficulty":"Beginner","SpeakerName":"James Bender","Technology":"Testing","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/BDD-in-NET-with-SpecFlow","EventType":"Session","Id":"7effa95b-0a2d-4fe9-bfcf-f49ff66b07a3","SessionLookupId":"BDD-in-NET-with-SpecFlow","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.jsonp/James-Bender"},{"Title":"Becoming a software strategist","Abstract":"As Software developers we are literally on the front-line everyday.

This talk puts us on a path toward fixing that.\n\nSome say \"mocks suck,\" because they reduce a test's realism and, therefore, our confidence that the code being tested actually works. Others use mocks to demarcate the outer boundary of an application, guarding the test from expensive or external dependencies (e.g. by faking a database or network resource). Still others see mocks as a \"setup of last resort\", using them only to mitigate the pain of hard-to-test code. Finally, some developers mock out every collaborator in every test, and their rationale is probably the least understood of them all!\n\nThis talk will serve as an opinionated (if broad-stroke) survey of the different ways people use test doubles (be they mocks, fakes, stubs, or spies). Our goal will be to establish a more sophisticated means of communicating on the topic. We'll discuss the pros & cons of the different approaches toward mocking, the smells of test double abuse, and the lessons I took away from writing my own test double library. \n\nMost importantly, the talk will emphasize why knowing what value we want from a test is a prerequisite to knowing the merits of using mock objects to write that test.

MongoDB bridges the gap between key-value stores – which are fast and scalable – and relational databases – which have rich functionality. Instead of storing data in tables and rows as one would with a relational database, MongoDB stores JSON documents with dynamic schemas. This flexible data model makes it easy to use MongoDB and to adapt the database seamlessly as applications evolve.\n\nThis workshop will provide an overview of MongoDB and its core capabilities. Coming out of the workshop, participants will have the tools they need to begin developing on MongoDB. The first section, “Building your First App with MongoDB,” covers the basics of MongoDB's document-oriented model, query language, map-reduce framework and deployment architecture. Next, in “Schema Design and Indexing,” we will address how to best model your data with MongoDB. In the third session, “Intro. To Replication and Sharding,” we will introduce the basic concepts around replica sets and sharding, which provide for high availability and horizontal scalability. In the fourth and final session, “Deploying your MongoDB Application,” we will show you how to operationalize MongoDB and deploy it on-premise or in the cloud.\n","Start":"2013-01-08T18:30:00Z","End":"2013-01-08T22:30:00Z","Room":"Portia/Wisteria","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Sridhar Nanjundeswaran","Technology":"Other","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/Building-Deploying-and-Scaling-MongoDB-Tuesday-Half-Day-PM","EventType":"PreCompiler","Id":"a4946e49-6430-418e-9550-17a152ab51cb","SessionLookupId":"Building-Deploying-and-Scaling-MongoDB-Tuesday-Half-Day-PM","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.jsonp/Sridhar-Nanjundeswaran"},{"Title":"C# Async Programming Workshop (Wednesday Half Day AM)","Abstract":"Asynchronous programming is much more than using the async and await keywords.

Join us for a Windows 8 app workshop to learn how you can take full advantage.  You'll learn from experts in a low-key, interactive way and then get hands-on time to apply what you’ve learned.\n\nIn this workshop you will gain an understanding of the platform design tenets, the programming language choices, and the integration points with the operating system and across Windows Store apps.  You'll learn the design principles behind the Windows Store apps and get insights into how to apply these principles in your own apps.  We'll cover updates to familiar .NET or Silverlight features and explore concepts that are new for Windows 8 and show you how to turn your XAML skills into money-making Windows Store apps.\n\nWindows 8 provides a new ready-to-use set of user interface controls and we'll show you how to use them to implement the common patterns that deliver great Windows 8 Store apps.  We'll teach you how to design adaptive layouts that ensure that your apps look great across all different screen sizes, resolutions and aspect ratios\n \nWith Windows 8 you'll design your app with the expectation that touch will be the primary input method of your users. Support for mouse and pen/stylus requires no additional work as Windows 8 provides this for free. We'll teach you about the touch language and patterns as well as how to incorporate mouse, keyboard and pen. You’ll also learn about the techniques to use for direct manipulation, such as touch targets, layout, margins and use of app bars.\n \nYour app's Tiles and Notifications keep it front and center increasing the connection with the user.  In this session we'll cover how you can include primary and secondary Tiles that are \"live\" encouraging the user to personalize their Start screen by pinning info from your app.\n \nWindows Store apps use contracts to declare the interactions that they support with other apps.  We'll teach you how to design apps that implement contracts to attract new users or delight existing users by providing them seamless integration with other apps or the system.","Start":"2013-01-08T13:30:00Z","End":"2013-01-08T22:30:00Z","Room":"Guava/Tamarind","Difficulty":"Beginner","SpeakerName":"Ben Riga","Technology":"Windows 8","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/Developing-on-Windows-8-Tuesday-Full-Day-","EventType":"PreCompiler","SecondarySpeakerName":"Peter Dwersteg","SecondarySpeakerBio":"Peter Dwersteg is a Windows 8 Evangelist at Microsoft.

Even if you’re perfectly happy with the framework your team uses, FubuMVC incorporates some ideas and features not found in today’s most popular frameworks such as Ruby on Rails or ASP.Net MVC.\nWe’ll start things off by showing how to start a minimalistic project with FubuMVC and do all the basic “Hello World” operations that every web framework does without breaking a sweat, but focus on how the FubuMVC “one model in, one model out” approach is different.  We’ll quickly follow that up by showing many of the features we believe are unique to FubuMVC like composable Html conventions, Url resolution logic, integrated authorization, and “meta-conventions.” \nFubuMVC relies very heavily on conventions for developer productivity as opposed to explicit directives like a Sinatra-flavored tool or higher ceremony tools like ASP.Net MVC.  We strongly prefer that approach because of how clean the code becomes, but that kind of “black magic” can easily cause just as much harm as good.  Fortunately the FubuMVC team has made a deep investment in diagnostics to explain the conventions that are active in your system, how they impact the behavior of your system, and full runtime tracing to visualize how an http request is handled by the various runtime parts of your FubuMVC application.  We’ll show you how to use the FubuMVC.Diagnostics package to understand and troubleshoot problems with your FubuMVC project.\nFubuMVC supports a very rich modularity story using the related Bottles library and a relentless focus on composing code in an “open/closed” fashion.  In this session we’ll quickly assemble a simple application by dropping in several off the shelf Bottles to handle infrastructure concerns like authentication and validation and even simplify usage of JavaScript assets like Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery.UI.  We’ll also show you how to build your own Bottles – both for reusable infrastructure concerns and how to isolate features into their own Bottle projects to facilitate Continuous Deployment strategies.\nFubuMVC also comes with a very powerful asset pipeline to fully control script and stylesheet loading, dependencies between assets, caching policies, and a transformation pipeline for minification, combining assets, and using languages like CoffeeScript, LeSS, and Sass.  We’ll show you how to use the asset pipeline in development and talk about the steps we’ve taken to improve performance and smooth out the development process.  We’ll also show you how to incorporate Html templates generated on the server as assets for “Single Page Application” style development.\nTime permitting, we’ll also show how we do automated testing against FubuMVC applications at the unit test, integration testing with the Kayak web server, and acceptance testing using WebDriver.\n","Start":"2013-01-09T18:30:00Z","End":"2013-01-09T22:30:00Z","Room":"Nile","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Jeremy Miller","Technology":".NET","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/Fully-Operational-FubuMVC-10-Wednesday-Half-Day-PM","EventType":"PreCompiler","SecondarySpeakerName":"Josh Arnold","SecondarySpeakerBio":"Forthcoming","Id":"10abb979-a25b-436e-809c-c5e85eaa6269","SessionLookupId":"Fully-Operational-FubuMVC-10-Wednesday-Half-Day-PM","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.jsonp/Jeremy-Miller"},{"Title":"Functional Testing with ASP.NET MVC","Abstract":"You unit test, even integration test your application.

What is a primary requirement, however, is U/X and this is where HTML5 lacks Native parity. \n\nIn this presentation, I'll address the Great Mobile Debate head-on -- you'll learn the current state of HTML 5 and understand what's good about it and what isn't. I'll show you where HTML 5 makes sense and how to leverage it correctly, and then I'll demonstrate an impressive list of mobile development frameworks that enable you to build awesome Native apps that consumers demand. And these frameworks don't demand mastery of Objective-C or Java -- like PhoneGap they abstract the raw platform, but unlike PhoneGap, they ultimately build an app capable of wowing an end user. \n","Start":"2013-01-10T18:45:00Z","Room":"Zambezi","Difficulty":"Beginner","SpeakerName":"Andrew Glover","Technology":"Mobile","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/HTML-5-and-the-Great-Mobile-Debate","EventType":"Session","Id":"c438a177-0cc8-4ce2-9c4a-89305c8eac1a","SessionLookupId":"HTML-5-and-the-Great-Mobile-Debate","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.jsonp/Andrew-Glover"},{"Title":"HTML5 Workshop (Wednesday Half Day AM)","Abstract":"HTML5 is exciting, and it does have the potential to change the Web as we know it, but it also gets blown out of proportion. What’s more, its true meaning can be elusive. It’s a broad topic, so it’s difficult to wrap your head around HTML5, much less know where to begin with this exciting new set of technologies. \n  \nThat's where our pre-compiler comes in. \n  \nOver the course of a half-day, we (Brandon Satrom and Clark Sell) will tell you everything you need to know to get started with the next generation of open web technologies. We'll start with an overview of what HTML5 is, and why it matters, before moving quickly through major aspects of the core HTML5 specifications. Then, we'll discuss highlights of CSS3, major new JavaScript APIs and language features, before we end with a discussion on graceful degradation and adopting HTML5 without leaving older browsers behind.  Throughout the day, we'll mix in hands-on exercises and labs so that you can leave with a working understanding of these technologies, and how you can begin to apply them immediately. This session is platform agnostic, so all you need to attend get your hands dirty is a text editor (like TextMate, Vim, e, Visual Studio or WebMatrix) and your favorite, modern browser to learn how to make the web shine.","Start":"2013-01-09T13:30:00Z","End":"2013-01-09T17:30:00Z","Room":"Zambezi","Difficulty":"Beginner","SpeakerName":"Brandon Satrom","Technology":"Web","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/HTML5-Workshop-Wednesday-Half-Day-AM","EventType":"PreCompiler","SecondarySpeakerName":"Clark Sell","SecondarySpeakerBio":"Forthcoming","Id":"a245399f-d41d-4598-9ecc-9646927d42e8","SessionLookupId":"HTML5-Workshop-Wednesday-Half-Day-AM","SpeakerURI":"/api/speakers.jsonp/Brandon-Satrom"},{"Title":"I Am Designer and So Can You!","Abstract":"For many developers, design does not come naturally. Lucky for you, you have ME! (Congrats on your recent acquisition of my friendship and knowledge.) Let me be the first to tell you design isn’t as complicated as it may seem. It all boils down to three basic strategies that we’ll discuss in this session.\n\nFirst, we’ll go over the fundamentals of grid structure. This will include how to set the content to maximize space allowance, and create an appropriate hierarchy to convey your content based on importance. Second, we’ll take a brief trip down color-theory lane. Theory? Yes, there is theory behind all UI color choices and you’ll learn what that means and why. Last, get ready, this is the big finale; we’re going to talk type! Type is a huge part of design and is often neglected or simply thought of as the alphabet. Each typeface tells a story and you want to make sure you’re picking one that’s right for your message.\n\nIf all of this sounds over your head, fear not, I’ll hold your hand and go slow.

With the ascent of jQuery, developers are realizing that JavaScript is more than just a way to validate data or perform some simple functions. It's a powerful language that is quickly becoming the engine driving most web applications. But for most developers, their exposure is limited to using JavaScript through frameworks, such as jQuery, and they really haven't been exposed to the true power of JavaScript.\n\nIn this session, we'll learn about some features of JavaScript that you may not be familiar with.

Developers have struggled trying to find the most appropriate area to place logic within the system. Initially the ease of writing views in ERB led many developers to stow code at the front of the application. Then we began finding the views to difficult to maintain so we moved the logic into controllers or helpers. Eventually this also became difficult to maintain so we developed \"best practices\" like skinny controllers and fat models. Active Record domain models naturally become the dumping ground of logic within the system but sooner or later this leads to brittle, unmaintainable, bug filled systems.\nCoupling persistence, validation, advanced querying, and business logic all into the same class inevitably leads to extremely fat models with any system of significance. Skinny controllers are definitely worth striving for, but shoveling all of the business logic into a class that is already overburdened with with three other concerns is a recipe for disaster. When you find yourself using factories, fixtures, or mocks to construct 8 different class dependencies, it's time to admit that fat models are not a solution worth aspiring to.\nThis talk will cover some different approaches for segregating the multiple concerns of fat Active Record models into loosely coupled, cohesive classes with single responsibilities.

In the real world automated testing efforts frequently fail because the tests are too time-consuming to author, too brittle when the underlying application changes, too flaky with asynchronous timing, or just flat out too slow.  After way too much teeth gnashing and a lot of struggling, I think my team has hit on a workable formula for successful test automation.  I’ll share our lessons learned about which tests are worth writing and which aren’t, balancing cheaper whitebox tests versus more comprehensive blackbox testing, and how to express the test scenarios to promote readability and minimize coupling.  I’ll show you some relatively simple strategies for dealing with asynchronous screen behavior.  I’ll demonstrate the approach we use to make setting up test data as declarative as possible while trying to decouple the test scenarios from being coupled to the application internals.  Lastly, I’ll talk about the application architecture choices you can make to reduce the effort to reward ration of your automated testing effort. \nMy previous team used StoryTeller, WebDriver, Jasmine, and TeamCity to create and execute our automated tests, but I believe that these techniques are applicable to other tools like Cucumber, SpecFlow,m or WatiN/Watir as well.\n","Start":"2013-01-09T13:30:00Z","End":"2013-01-09T17:30:00Z","Room":"Nile","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Jeremy Miller","Technology":"Testing","URI":"/api/sessions.jsonp/Making-Test-Automation-with-Web-Applications-Work-Wednesday-Half-Day-AM","EventType":"PreCompiler","SecondarySpeakerName":"Josh Arnold","SecondarySpeakerBio":"Joshua is a husband, father, passionate software craftsman, and aspiring man of God.
